			<p><strong>Doobert Verified status explained:</strong></p>
			<p>Volunteers that apply for and receive "Doobert Verified" status will display with a Doobert Verified badge next to their name when they sign-up for a leg in your transport.  If this badge is not colored in it means they are not yet Doobert Verified and are a general volunteer.</p>
            <p>When a volunteer applies for Doobert Verified status:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Doobert conducts limited research of publicly available information to identify concerns with the volunteer's application related to the safe transport and care of animals.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>We DO NOT conduct full background checks.</b></li>
              <br>
              <li>The volunteer uploads a copy of his or her driver's license, but Doobert does not verify that the volunteer's drivers license is in good standing and Doobert does not request or verify the status of vehicle insurance the volunteer uses to transport the animals.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Doobert reaches out to references provided by the volunteer, but is limited to the information the reference chooses to provide or if they respond to our inquiry. We request and contact three (3) references for the volunteer, and require at least one (1) reference to reply before we will approve the volunteer.</li>
              <br>
            </ul>
            <p>Doobert provides only limited information about Doobert Verified volunteers.  Doobert does not verify that Doobert Verified volunteers meet specific qualifications set by transport coordinators and organizations.  Transport coordinators and organizations are expected to use common sense and conduct independent research regarding volunteers signing up for transports to ensure the organization or transport coordinator is comfortable with each volunteer working on the transport.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding a particular Doobert volunteer, or would like further information regarding which information we collected on a particular volunteer, please contact us at support@doobert.com or by clicking on the Help/Feedback tab.</p>
