		<p class="text22">Developed in 2017, the Foster Assessment System (“FAST-15”) provides a fast and efficient snapshot of your organization’s foster program. The FAST-15 supports nonprofit organizational effectiveness by focusing on the foster caregiver’s perspective and using a comprehensive foster 
	attitudes and engagement survey.</p>
		<p class="marb20">By surveying fosters about the key areas of foster care that are most related to challenges such as turnover and engagement, the FAST-15 highlights your foster program strengths as well as areas for improvement. The FAST-15 was developed using best practices and subject matter expertise to ensure a robust assessment and practical results.</p>
