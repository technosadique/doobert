        <p>Rescues and Shelter groups always appreciate new and passionate animal lovers that are willing to volunteer their time and help save more animals.  Whether helping virtually through Doobert.com, or in person at their facility, the first step is reaching out to offer your assistance.  You can do this in a number of different ways.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>On Doobert.com each organization has an organization profile page where you can learn more about them and obtain the contact information to reach out to them if you're interested in helping them out.</li>
          <li>You also have the option to Join an organization on Doobert.com simply by going under the organization item in the left menu and clicking Join organization.  There you are able to search for the organization you want to join, and to indicate how you can help them.  Don't forget to include a note in the free-form text box explaining why they would want to add you to their organization.  We'll automatically notify them that you're requesting to join up with them, and we'll e-mail you either way with their response.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Doobert.com is proud to support the efforts of all of the volunteers and professionals that are working hard to save more animals.</p>
