	<h2 class="title marb25">How the FAST-15 Process works</h2>
		<p>The FAST-15 Process includes surveying your organization's foster volunteers for their input on key areas of your foster program. We automatically capture and compile this information and produce an organization specific report for you including best practice recommendations for how to improve key areas. Assuming you maintain at
least 10 foster volunteers in your program, we recommend you run the FAST-15 process every year in order to track growth.</p>
		<h2 class="title marb25">The FAST-15 Survey</h2>
		<p>To better understand the foster experience at your organization, we have constructed a survey that you, the foster manager/coordinator, will distribute to your foster caregivers. This survey provides information regarding 1) your fosters’ levels of engagement in your program, and 2) fosters’ feelings, attitudes, and reactions to your program.</p>
		<h2 class="title marb25">Sample Survey Questions</h2>
		<p>To give you an idea of the types of questions that your fosters will be asked about your organization, we have included sample questions from our survey:</p>
		<ul class="bullet">
			<li>I feel appreciated at my organization.</li>
			<li>I am satisfied with the communication I receive from this organization.</li>
			<li>I’m able to rely on other people in my organization when I need extra help.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="text15">The questions are rated in terms of how much the foster agrees with each statement. The FAST-15 evaluates the health of your foster program on 11 different key areas. To see a list of these key areas, <a href="<?php echo base_url();?>home/submit_org_info" class="linku">click here</a>.</p>
		<p class="text15">There are four main steps in the FAST-15 process. To gain a deeper understanding of the overall process and the time commitment involved, please consult the brief outline provided below:</p>
